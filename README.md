## Hotseat Pacther
A patching script for medieval 2 hotseats that allows logging in into any faction without needing to know their passwords and using the console without providing a password, even if the console was disabled in the hotseat.

## Usage
Download [this file](https://github.com/Overload2664/hotseat_patch/releases/download/v0.1/hotseat_patch.exe) and put medieval2.exe in the same folder as the downloaded file, then run the program. A backup named `medieval2_backup.exe` will be generated in case you want to role back. The patches have now been apllied and ready to use
